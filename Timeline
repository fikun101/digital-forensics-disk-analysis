# Investigation Timeline & Chain of Custody

## üìÖ Case Timeline

## üîê Hash Verification
Hashing was conducted to ensure forensic soundness and continuity of evidence.
- **Before Analysis**:
  - MD5: `hash_md5_original`
  - SHA-256: `hash_sha256_original`
- **After Analysis**:
  - MD5: `hash_md5_final`
  - SHA-256: `hash_sha256_final`

‚úÖ **Result**: All hash values matched. The disk image was not altered during investigation.

## üîó Chain of Custody Protocol
- Evidence image stored in a secure, access-controlled location.
- Write-blocking methods employed to prevent any accidental or intentional modification.
- All actions logged and attributed to forensic examiner (Ahonsi Vincent Oluwafeyikunayomi).
- Analysis conducted exclusively on forensic duplicates to preserve the original image.

## Summary
A structured timeline and strict adherence to chain of custody principles ensured the forensic process remained legally admissible, transparent, and tamper-proof from acquisition through reporting.
